# Covid-19 Virus Data API

As more and more people are closely following the current global pandemic, we've built this API for easy access
to easily access John Hopkins CSSE data from: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

The API automatically updates every hour, by checking for new data. It exposes several REST endpoints.

### How to run:

- Clone this repo
- npm install
- npm start 

### Run with docker

- Follow the previous steps
- Instead of npm start, run npm build:docker
